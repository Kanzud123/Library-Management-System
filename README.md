# Library Management System

Language   : Java

Framework  : Java Swing

Description: The main objective of the library management system is to manage the entire activity of a library. The system can keep track of all the information about the books with their details (such as titles, authors, ISBNs, publication dates, genres, etc). This app also stores information about library members, including their contact details, borrowing history, and any fines or fees owed. This feature helps librarians manage patron accounts and deliver personalized services. Librarians can use the app to check out items to patrons and check them back in when they are returned. This app offers an online catalog accessible to patrons, allowing them to search for items, and manage their accounts remotely.
