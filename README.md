# Library Management System

Language   : Java

Framework  : Java Swing

Description: The main objective of the library management system is to handle the entire activity of a library. The system can keep tracking, adding, modifying, and deleting all the information about the books with their details (such as titles, authors, ISBNs, publication dates, genres, and more). This app also stores information about library members, including their contact details, borrowing history, and any fines or fees owed. This feature helps librarians manage patron accounts and deliver personalized services. These management apps facilitate the smooth circulation of library materials. Librarians can use the app to check out items to patrons and check them back in when they are returned. This offers an online catalog accessible to patrons, allowing them to search for items, and place holds, and manage their accounts remotely.
